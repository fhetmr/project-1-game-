# project-1-game-
The game is open for modifications and versions. I'm not a coder, I just want a cool game.


I hope you will help me improve the game, not necessarily the whole thing, you can concentrate on specific aspects (like physics, the world, shaders) as I said above, I'm not a coder, but if you find this code, I'm not against criticism.
